# Introduction

pyGCS (Grid Convergence Study) is a python package that calculates the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) for solutions obtained through numerical analysis using computational grids to establish the error-band of the solution with respect to the numerical grid used. This package implements the equations presented in [1] and [2].
